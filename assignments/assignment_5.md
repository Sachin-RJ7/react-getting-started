1. What is difference between Named Export, Default Export and * as Export ?
- Named exports allow us to share multiple objects, functions or variables from a single file and were introduced with the release of ES2015.

- Named exports are imported with curly braces in various files and must be imported using the name of the object, function or variable that was exported. 

- A default export can only export a single object, function, or variable and curly braces are omitted when importing in various files.
